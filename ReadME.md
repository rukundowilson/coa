gallery
-------
In gallery challenge l used overlays on pictures to make sure that
a picture is compatible with text.
I have used responsive properties in setting heights and width(min-height,max-width,...)
I've used media queries to make text disappear as it layout view provided in figma for small screen

arrayMap.js
-----------
In arrayMap l declared constants array and target as l don't want to change it accidentally.
l also declared tempSums array to store my sums
my first loop is finding sums and check whether they are equal to target, if not store them. second loop returns true when "checking if in our array of sums we have sum that is equal to Sum minus target we can add to a current sum to get a target"

stringTransform.js
------------------
l have perform to ascii operation function
get the length of text
If length is divisible by both 3 and 5  perform both operations.
If length is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
 If length is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.

run arrayMap.js and stringTransform.js
--------------------------------------
to run this you need node js environment 
navigate to challenge dir 
open terminal
type node 'filename.js' file name is arrayMap or stringTransform
